### Install dependencies/ Start the app

Create a new .env file, insert your IP address to run in the local environment:

`EXPO_PUBLIC_DEVICEIP = "YOUR IP ADDRESS"`

Then:

```
(For frontend)
npm install
nupm run ios

(For backend)
cd Backend
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```

### Simulator

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
